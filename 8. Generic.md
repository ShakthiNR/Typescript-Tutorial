# Generics - Reusable

1. Type will locked based on value if <Type> is used
```ts
//<Type> can be written as <T>

function getValue <Type> (val:Type):Type{
    return val
}

getValue(1) //number
getValue("One") //string

```

2. Array in Generics

```ts
//Incoming value is array of obj(Products). So ArrOfObj type is locked in <T>[] and <T> and T will be an object
function getSearchProducts<T>(products: T[]): T {
    // do some database operations
    const myIndex = 3
    return products[myIndex]
}

//<T> and <T,> are same as , added to differentiate from Component Tag
const getMoreSearchProducts = <T,>(products: T[]): T => {
    //do some database operations
    const myIndex = 4
    return products[myIndex]
}```
